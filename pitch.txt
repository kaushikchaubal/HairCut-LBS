	My name is Henry
	here to Talk about my haircut experience
	Went to barber and said 'I want it shorter'

Personal Story
	risk: will the wife like it?
	Is there a business opportunity? We decided to explore...

Out on the streets...
	Spoke to 23 men about haircut - face similar troubles	
	"This is not how I usually look like!" - Julian M Baladurage, Mentor @ LBS Hackathon
	"My wife would love if I use this app" - Manan Vohra, Mentor @ LBS Hackathon
	Did you know that an average 18-35 male spends 216 pounds/ year on haircuts? a million-dollar industry and yet are left unsatisfied!
	We had found our problem to solve
	Otherside of the story
		8 barber shops around central London - realised that with the right information given to the barber, it is not difficult to get a consistent haircut
		3 bits of information - 
			how long since the last haircut
			Details of length, etc
			Picture of your 'perfect' haircut on you
		competition - barber booking app- Whanda, Asapp - geo targeting app, yelp
		but none is addressing this problem.
	Combining our insights from both sides of the market, we started a journey to create the perfect solution for a consistent haircut
